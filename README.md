## Features

- Add, delete, and update notes functionality.
- Responsive design using CSS and Bootstrap.

## Languages and Frameworks Used
- [Python](https://www.python.org/doc/)
- [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) / [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) 
- [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com)
- [Bootstrap -v4.6.2](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.6/getting-started/introduction/)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-github-username>/Django-NotesApp.git
```


> ### For Windows
2. Use package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install Django. _(You should create a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) first if you want.)_
```
pip install django
```
3. Apply Migrations
```
python manage.py migrate
```
4. Run the development server
```
python manage.py runserver
```
5. Access the application at http://localhost:8000 in your web browser.


> [!NOTE] 
> As this project uses  _bootstrap framework_, it requires an __internet connection__ to work. The app will run without any issues but the front-end layout will not work properly.


## Usage
- _Register for a new account or login if you already have one._
- _Once logged in, you can add, delete, and update your notes._
- _Enjoy organizing your notes efficiently!_

## Future Improvements
1. Improve the UI and make it more user-friendly.
2. Update the bootstrap framework version.
3. Include more functionality in the NotesApp.
